"Hello little eclipse, you seem to be lost."
{<0I was looking for the bar.>;<1I'm only lost because you eclipsed my vision with your beauty ;)>;<2Your sense of style is lost and I only wish you were an eclipse right now. Away!>}
====================
"The ISS is quite vast! Come, I shall accompany you there!"
<&e(3)>
"So forward! Come and join me at the bar! I shall buy you a drink."
<&e(3)>
<&d2>
"With how things are going in the war, I may very well permanently eclipse soon."
<&e(3)>
====================
<&d2>
Dax leads you to the bar. With all of the amenities offered at the ISS, it's no wonder factions from both sides
of the war enjoy each other's company here.
<&w>
Dax greets the bartender with a smile places the order,
and the two exchange heartfelt words, the bartender hands Dax the drinks then walks away with 
tears streaming down their face. Dax turns to you grimly.

"This war has taken much from all of us. Our dear bartender lost their offspring last week. 
I must ensure I'm deployed in a different sector in tomorrow's battle."
{<4Do you work in military IT?>;<5Can I be deployed in your sector? ;)>;<6The bartender's your enemy! Kill them here!>}
====================
"Yep, graduated from Drury Space Academy's IT program."
<&e(7)>
"Yes if that's an innuendo, no if you mean the battlefield."
<&e(7)>
<&d2>"You must be an offspring of those who started this war."

====================
"If you'd like I could teach you the basics of manipulating warp drives 
to allow accurate and safe relocation of your coordinates 
to any location you desire within 500 solar systems!"
{<8You had me at "If".>;<9Anywhere my coordinates can intersect with your coordinates would be most desirable. ;)>;<10Psh, only 500 solar systems?! Ever heard of hyper drives?>}
====================
"My basic equipment is back in my room, let us not waste another second!"
"That could either be potentially fatal or a lot of fun! Let us find out!"
"Hyper drives are entirely too energy inefficient and much riskier for warping. I shall explain in greater detail in
my room!"
