Good day.
<&w>
How may I help you?
{<0You want to chat?>;<1I was just on my way.>}
=========
I don't mind a good conversation once in a while.
<&w>
What's on your mind?
{<2What do you think of the war?>;<3Do you like your job?>;<4I would like to get to know you better.>}
=========
Well, goodbye then.
<&x>
=========
Well, it brings in buisness. That's the only good thing about it. I get to see people from all over. Like yourself.
<&w>
That, however, is where the perks end. I've seen too many mourning the loss of loved ones. A tragic thing.
{<5Have you lost anyone?>;<6Ah..>}
I think that is enough.
<&x>
=========
Can I help you with anything else?
{<2What do you think of the war?>;<3Do you like your job?>;<4I would like to get to know you better.>;<1I was just on my way.>}
=========
Well, goodye then.
<&x>
=========
Some days.
<&w>
Can I help you with anything else?
{<2What do you think of the war?>;<3Do you like your job?>;<4I would like to get to know you better.>;<1I was just on my way.>}
=========
Then stay a while. And come back tomorrow.
