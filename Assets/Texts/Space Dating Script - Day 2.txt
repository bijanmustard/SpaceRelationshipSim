Day 2

Map room: Bryce, Dax (if not killed)

Dax: 

Bryce: (neutral) What in the pollination do we have here? You don't look like much of a soldier.

1A. {You're right, my sector hasn't issued me a weapon yet.}
2A. {I'm a lover, not a fighter. A pollinator, not a biter.}
3A. {There are other ways to fight in a war than with just a weapon}

Bryce Responses
1a. {(irritated) If you're with that Sector Y filth, you best leave me alone until tomorrow!}
2a. {(neutral) I can relate! But with Sector X giving me this gun, (irritated) I bite just fine now!}
3a. {(sad) You mean with pwopaganda and dipwomacy and - (irritated) Nonsense!
a plasma charged weapon is all I need!

Bryce: The commander says I'm looking at a promotion after next battle so I gotta keep my focus.
What do you do here to relax?

1B. {Drink my troubles away! (invite Bryce to the bar)} go to bar
2B. {Embarrass myself! (invite Bryce to Karaoke)} go to Karaoke
3B. {Inspire myself for battle! (invite Bryce to the pavillion)} go to Pavillion

Karaoke

Bryce manages to withold a few chuckles as you sing an "impressive" cover to a viral Internet song. (time+0:04)
Before you finish the last lyric, Bryce grabs the microphone from you and already has the machine change songs.
Bryce begins making inarticulate sounds in a rhythm to the bass of the song. The song chosen has no lyrics. (time+0:03)
Several more songs and laughs are enjoyed. (time+1:00)

Bryce: (surprised) That was actually a lot of fun! (neutral) Win tomorrow's battle so we can do it again!

"The Galactic needs you!"

had to become better.
(irritated) I have to fight!
